In this challenge the idea is to split the string into array to loop through all the elements and use them to populate two new arrays: oddArray and evenArray.
If the index number of the element is even, this element to the evenArray afer being changed to upperCase and to oddArray goes unchanged.
In the other case, when element index number is odd the function adds an uppercased element into oddAray and unchanged element into evenArray.
